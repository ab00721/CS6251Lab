                <dt>What is a Yurt?</dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four
                    feet off the ground. Each yrut is fully enclosed
                    with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome
                    that can be opened.
                </dd>
                <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
                <dd>Each yrt is furnished with a queen-size bed with
                    down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping
                    experience included electricity and a sink with hot
                    and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities
                    are located in the lodge.
                </dd>
                <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoues and
                    plan to dress for changing weather with light layers
                    of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight
                    and a sense of adventrue!
